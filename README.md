> This repository contains the solution for the given exam.

## Cypress Exercise

To give an overview to the solution, basically I followed the Page Object model in creating the automation test. You can navigate on the pages folder to check each pages used in doing the test and its correspoding properties. At the same time I divided each task to 3 different test cases. 

1. TC_001.js = User successfully logs-in, add new address and purchase 1 item.
2. TC_002.js = User successfully logs-in, add new address and purchase 2 items.
3. TC_003.js = User verifies if search functionality is working as expected.


**Note:** You might encounter some errors when running the automation script. When this happen just click the referesh button on the Cypress runner to re-run the script
